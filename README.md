# Facial Emotion Recognition using HOG and SVM

This repository contains the implementation used for the CO3519 Artificial Intelligence coursework.
It evaluates a classical facial emotion recognition (FER) pipeline using Histogram of Oriented
Gradients (HOG) features and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification.

The system is evaluated on the JAFFE and Cohn–Kanade (CK) datasets, with K-Nearest Neighbours
and Naïve Bayes included as baseline classifiers.
